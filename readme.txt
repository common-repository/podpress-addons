This plugin is an Addon for powerPress or podPress that gives you a Widget to lists your podCasts and links to the popout player. Someday I hope to also make it build a dropdown of mp3s in your uploads directory on the add/edit Post page for easy insertion.

== Description ==

Just place the Widget on your sidebar to display links to your podCasts.

This plugin requires that powerPress or podPress is already installed.

Plugin Updated Sept-28th

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What do I do after I activate the Plugin? =

Go to the Widgets menu in the WordPress Admin and add the "List podCasts" Widget to your Sidebar or Footer Area.

You might not have any podCasts or you don't have powerPress or podpress installed.
